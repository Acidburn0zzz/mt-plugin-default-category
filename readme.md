# Default Category plugin for Movable Type

This plugin lets you specify a default category for entries. There's not much more to it than that.

Go to Tools > Plugins > Default Category > Settings to select an existing category to be used as the default.

When saving a new entry if no category is chosen the selected default category will be placed with the entry. This plugins also works through the XML-RPC interface, where it is exceptionally useful if you blog from Facebook, for example, where categories can not be specified.

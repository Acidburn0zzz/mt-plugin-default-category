# Default Category plugin for Melody and Movable Type

This plugin lets you specify a default category for entries. There's not much more to it than that.

Visit this plugin's Settings screen at the blog level to select a default category for the CMS, and a default category for the XML-RPC and Atom APIs.

When saving a new entry, if no category is chosen, the selected default category will be placed with the entry. This plugins also works through the XML-RPC and Atom interfaces, where it is exceptionally useful if you blog from Facebook or Flickr, for example, where categories can not be specified.

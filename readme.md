# Default Category plugin for Movable Type

This plugin lets you specify a default category for entries. There's not much
more to it than that.

Visit this plugin's Settings screen at the blog level to select a default
category for the CMS, and a default category for the XML-RPC and Atom APIs.

When saving a new entry, if no category is chosen, the selected default
category will be placed with the entry. This plugin also works through the
XML-RPC and Atom interfaces, where it is exceptionally useful if you blog from
Facebook or Flickr, for example, where categories can not be specified.
